      "Abstract India's tryst with internet intermediary liability can be traced back almost two decades to when the Information Technology Act (IT Act), 2000 saw the light of day. With the rapid evolution of both the internet and its users in India, it would not be a stretch to say that the legislators in India have been playing catch-up with technology. The legal framework governing intermediary liability has undergone significant changes, particularly with the introduction of the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021.",

      "Introduction It is trite to say that copyright is a bundle of rights. This truism is best demonstrated when a song is played on the radio. Under the Copyright Act in India, copyright attaches to original literary, musical and dramatic works; sound recordings and cinematograph films. The creation of a song at the most basic level involves the composition of lyrics (literary work) and music (musical work). Both the Bombay High Court and Delhi High Court have provided clarity on the separate copyright subsisting in underlying works.",
